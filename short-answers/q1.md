What is Event Driven Architecture?

# Answer

Event Driven Archietecture is used to describe programming where code will be invoked when there user events are enacted. Inside of Javascript, there are DOM events that can be selected. This allows a feedback loop to be created where when the event triggers is enacted, a callback function is invoked.

Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) is unique because it relies on asynchronous functions that are executed only when a specific user event occurs. This is typically implemented in JavaScript using the `.addEventListener()` method. This method requires two parameters: the event type (e.g., 'click', 'mouseover') and an event handler function. When the specified event type is triggered by the user on the targeted element, the event handler is invoked to execute the desired functionality.

You answer could benefit from explaining the asynchronous nature of Event-Driven Architecture and the concept of a system actively "listening," events to respond accordingly.
