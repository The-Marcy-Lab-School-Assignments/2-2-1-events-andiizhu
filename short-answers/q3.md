# Question

Why is event delegation helpful?

# Answer

Event delegation is helpful because it allows event management to be simplified. Instead of having to have an event listener for every element, one event listener covers all of the children elements. This is especially true if children elements are dynamically added and removed. Event delegation also simplifies memory and reduces time because there are less reduant code as there is not an event listener for every child element.
